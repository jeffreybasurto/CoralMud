RocketMud version 0.3
---

This is a ruby version of Brian Graversen's SocketMUD(tm).  It should run 
on any platform that Ruby runs on.  It's been minimally re-architected to 
be more object-oriented.

RocketMUD has pretty much the same feature set of SocketMUD with the 
exception of MCCP support.  I didn't see any point in bothering with it.  

* Supports 'say', 'quit', 'help', 'who', 'linkdead', 'shutdown', 'commands' 
  and 'save' commands.
* Supports ansi - see help ansi for details
* Event scheduling system
* Any help file changes are automatically detected and loaded.
* Code is reloaded by the tick event so there is no need for a copyover 
  command.  This is rather simple and crude and if you mess up the code and 
  it can't be loaded you just might have to kill and restart the server.
* Player files are stored in YAML format instead of the Dikulike format.  
  There is just a single player file, .yml, not a .pfile and .profile.

The server is run with the command:
$ ruby rocket.rb &

The default port is 9009.  You can change the constant MUDPORT in the code 
to use a different one.

An administrative user is supplied with the name, 'One' and the password is
'potrzebie'.  

To build the html documentation run the following rake task:
$ rake rdoc
