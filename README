CoralMud is primarily developed and tested under Ubuntu 9.10 and 10.04 LTS for Ruby 1.9.1.   
CoralMud is not expected to run under Ruby 1.8.x.  Works well under Ruby 1.9.2 preview and Ruby head.

CoralMud itself requires no compiling or installation.  You simply need to have the more current version of Ruby installed. 

[http://www.ruby-lang.org You can get Ruby here.]  

CoralMud is cross platform, although not all libraries that CoralMud uses are cross-platform.   CoralMud is confirmed to work out of the box with gems installed for Linux and Mac.  It will become more likely as libraries become available for other operating systems.  Still waiting for some tests on windows. 

You will need to install a few gems.   After Ruby 1.9.x is installed you will have access to the gem command to install libraries.

{{{
   apt-get install aspell
   apt-get install aspell-en
   bundle install
}}}

If you're not logged in as administrator you will need to run gem as administrator.  (Or sudo gem install log4r, etc) If more libraries are required simply gem install them too. :)

Under windows sometimes the libraries are marked with a -win32 at the end.  You can see which gems are being installed witht he bundle command in the Gemfile.

To run CoralMud you simply extract the files from the zip or tar file you must download and from the top directory in the folder you abstract them to in command line:

{{{
  ruby coral.rb
}}}

CoralMud should boot up on default port.  You can change this port in constants.rb.   Also, you should setup imc.rb if you wish to use the built-in imc2 client. 

Furthermore, you'll need to have sqlite3 installed.  After .18 preview CoralMud uses Datamapper with sqlite3 as default.   This will require you setting up the database.rb file in /core.
