FILE HANDLING/SAVING & LOADING

Early in the project we used simple object serialization.  This was fraught with peril.  I'll spare you the details and
simply explain how we do things now.  Each class can mix-in CORALMUD::FileIO to define the methods #configure and 
#gen_configure.   #gen_configure will construct a map based on all instance variables by default.  If #to_configure_properties
is overloaded it should return an array of instance variables.  #configure will take this map as an argument to initialize
its variables.   #configure allows you to overload #version_control and #data_transform_on_load which allows you to hook
into the way it translates the hash into variables.  #gen_configure lets you overload #data_transform_on_save to accomplish
the same thing to transform the hash before it is returned.
