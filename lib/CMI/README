To run the client stand alone:
& ruby client.rb

This client is intended to be installed into another project to give access to
the CMI network.  Clients in C and C++ are likely to be written as well.  

The key thing that any client would have to be able to do is parse a specific
data type from JSON/YAML.  The only datatype transmitted is hash/map with 
strings as the key pairs.  There's many libraries out there to do it for you
but it should be easy enough to write a custom parser as well for this 
specific case.
