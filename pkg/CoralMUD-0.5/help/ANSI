RocketMud supports ANSI colors, and you can access them by using the
'#' character, followed by the colorkey from the table below.

Yellow    #yy #YY#n
Blue      #bb #BB#n
Green     #gg #GG#n
Red       #rr #RR#n
Cyan      #cc #CC#n
Purple    #pp #PP#n
Dark      #dd #DD#n
White     #ww #WW#n

Underline #uu#n 

The 'n' key is the default RocketMud color, and the mudcolor will
always revert to this color at the end of a string.
